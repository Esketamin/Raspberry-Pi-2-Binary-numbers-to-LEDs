# Raspberry-Pi-2-Binary-numbers-to-LEDs
Switches LEDs such that they show binary number representations

Uses the RPi.GPIO interface for Python to switch LEDs in a way that they show binary numbers.
The aim is to build a functional binary calculator, that has two rows of LEDs that represent binary, integer operators and
a third row of LEDs that represents the result.

As well there should be three Hardware-buttons to increment the LED-numbers on the first two mentioned rows and one to cycle
between basic calculus operations.

Two more LEDs shall represent the currently chosen calculus operation.

As soon as the software is finished, building instructions will follow.
